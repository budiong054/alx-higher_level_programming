# 0x0C. Python - Almost a circle

### 0. If it's not tested it doesn't work
- All files, classes and methods must be unit testes and be PEP 8 validated

### 1. Base class
Create a folder named [models]() with an empty file `__init__.py` inside - with this file, the folder will become a Python package

Write a `Base` class in the [models/base.py]()
- private class attribute `__nb_objects = 0`
- class constructor: `def __init__(self, id=None):`
